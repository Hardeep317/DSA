// Time Complexity : The time taken by an algorithm to perform operation respected to its input is called time complexity.

Time Complexity for some famous algorithms :

1. Selection sort --> O(n^2)
2. Bubble sort --> O(n^2)
3. Insertion sort --> O(n^2)
4. Heap sort --> O(n log(n))
5. Quick sort --> O(n^2)
6. Merge sort --> O(n log(n))
7. Searching in 2d Array --> O(n^2)
